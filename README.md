# MS Teams
Microsoft Teams integration for Dynatrace
This integration works via WebHooks for Microsoft Teams.
Find further information in the [Dynatrace community](https://community.dynatrace.com/community/display/DL/Slack+Integration+Plugin)

I used the code from [HipChat](https://github.com/dynaTrace/Dynatrace-HipChat-Plugin) to maker it work. Huge thanks to them.


Tested with Dynatrace 7.0.6.1013 this works.

## Installation


## Future development
It is entirely possible to use the Action buttons in Teams to close Incidents with comments.
This should be a future work.
